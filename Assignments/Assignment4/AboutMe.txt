Hi, My name is Jean Luc Sita Mbuya. I'm a student at Seneca Polytechnic. I'm currently doing a graduate certificate in Business Information Technology, which I like to describe as the learning of the most relevant technics and practices for the implementation of IT infrastructure in the Business environment. I'm a patinate of science, technology and nature. I love to learn and understand how things work, and fascinated by the complexity mixed into the harmony of natural and artificial existing things. That includes more abstract things like music.
